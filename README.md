# Cryptography
Codes and outputs for the encryption and decryption of some popular ciphers.<br>

1. Playfair cipher - It is a manual symmetric encryption technique and was the first literal digram substitution cipher. The [playfair-cipher](https://github.com/ruthussanketh/cryptography/tree/main/playfair-cipher) folder contains the encryption as well as decryption codes with their outputs. [This](https://ruthussanketh.medium.com/playfair-cipher-encryption-fa8ed7df8ea5) Medium article is a detailed tutorial for encryption using the Playfair cipher and [this](https://ruthussanketh.medium.com/playfair-cipher-decryption-c43b698b45bd) article is a detailed tutorial on decryption using the Playfair cipher.<br>
2. Merkle-Hellman Knapsack Cryptosystem - It is a public key cryptosystem, meaning that two keys are used, a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. It is based on the subset sum problem. The [merkle-hellman knapsack](https://github.com/ruthussanketh/cryptography/tree/main/merkle-hellman-knapsack) folder contains the encryption code as well as its output. [This](https://ruthussanketh.medium.com/merkle-hellman-knapsack-encryption-920ffc59b26e) Medium article is a detailed tutorial for encryption using the Merkle-Hellman Knapsack encryption.
